# Stimuli from Experiment 2: Scene-based Quality

This folder contains all stimuli used in the 2. experiment of the paper which
conducted a scene-based quality test. The stimuli were generated using a
[recording done by the FH
KÃ¶ln](https://github.com/ssr-scenes/fh-koeln/tree/master/anechoic/audio).

All of the stimuli are created in order to listen binaural via headphones to
them. They include already a headphone compensation filter for usage
with AKG K601 headphones. The filter and used head-related transfer functions
are [freely
available](https://github.com/TWOEARS/data/tree/master/impulse_responses/qu_kemar_anechoic)
together with the [Sound Field Synthesis
Toolbox](https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs) which was used to generate the
degredations by applying Wave Field Synthesis.
