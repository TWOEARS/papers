## Stimuli from Experiment 2: Scene-based Quality

This folder contains all stimuli used in the 2. experiment of the paper which
was a scene-based quality test. The stimuli were generated using a
[recording done by the FH
KÃ¶ln](https://github.com/ssr-scenes/fh-koeln/tree/master/anechoic/audio).

All of the stimuli are created in order to listen binaural via headphones to
them. They include already a headphone compensation filter for usage
with AKG K601 headphones. The filter and used head-related transfer functions
are [freely
available](https://github.com/TWOEARS/data/tree/master/impulse_responses/qu_kemar_anechoic)
together with the [Sound Field Synthesis
Toolbox](https://github.com/sfstoolbox/sfs) which was used to generate the
degredations by applying Wave Field Synthesis.

Figure 1 presents the 10 different conditions of the experiment ordered after their perceived
quality, starting with the best one. The scene was created of three sound
sources, two guitars to the side of the listener and a singer in front of the
listener. A grey point in the figure shows a non-degraded source, a blue or red
dot a degraded source.
